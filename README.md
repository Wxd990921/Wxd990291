### **About Me**
-My name is Xidi Wang, and People could call me Darren. My hometown is Yunnan, a province in China that borders Vietnam, Myanmar, and Laos. Although it is not a wealthy place, different cultures are confluence here, and it has excellent natural resources and good weather. It is famous for tourism. I was living with my parents when I lived in China. My father was always working outside, and my mother was a housewife.

-Software development is not my first choice. I wanted to enroll in the CAD technical at first, but there was no sit for that program. I came to MITT because I want to find a job to get PR in Canada, so I don't wish to just wait until January. Also, there are many generalities between the two programs, that they both need people using computer language to write instructions to finish some objectives. I thought I could learn CAD without instruction if I mastered software development. Let's be honest I am a lazy guy, and in my opinion, the essential function of technology is it saves people's time doing duplicate labor to have more time to relax or study.

-I like video games and anime. I collect many figures from some anime and video games, and most of the collection is the transformers. I think the transformers are ensembles of modern industry and design. I like to play video games in my free time, but I am not a good player.
